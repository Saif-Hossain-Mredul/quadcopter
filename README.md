# Quadcopter Firmware and Hardware

This repository contains the firmware and hardware design files for a quadcopter project using ESP8266, MPU-6050, HC-12, and Arduino. The firmware includes flight control algorithms and communication protocols implemented on ESP8266, interfacing with MPU-6050 for inertial measurements and HC-12 for wireless communication. This is the picture of the designed PCB.
